# MP3_PICO_REMOTE
A music remote display for Smartphones made with Pi Pico

Like Sony remote controllers for Sony Walkman, the PI Pico is configured with a USB-C and a tiny oled display.

Project goals:
1. Display the "now playing" info from Smartphone (androind and Iphone)
2. Volume and Track control
4. App switching (favorite apps like Amazon Play music, Spotify, on-board MP3 player)


Based on Raspberry Pi Pico Hardware, interfacing with USB-C and USB-C DAC (pass through) on GPIOs
